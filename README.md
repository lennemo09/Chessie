# Chessie
A playable Python GUI chess engine/game, with the goal of creating a base for making a reinforcement learnt chess AI.

# Motivation
I wanted to make a chess AI that can play decently above an average player but since I do not know how to play chess very well, it would take me a very long time to make a heuristics chess bot, so I decided to let the bot learn how to play itself rather than trying to teach it what I don't know.
It is also (kinda) my first GUI application so that was also a new learning experience.

* Create an actual game with game over rules (when one king dies).
* Most important: A functioning machine learning framework.
